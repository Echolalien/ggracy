# GGracy - A 2d plotter using CoreXY
GGracy is designed for art installations and other large custom CNC rigs with low accuracy requirements. THIS IS NOT A 3D PRINTER. The jury is out on how reliable and accurate GGracy can be but for the moment it should be assumed to be only capable of slow, gross movements and not fine microsteps. It is designed to be mounted to walls or a wooden frame using 3mm screws. Its parts are all modular and printable on a ~30cm print bed. The fusion360 STEP file includes variables to control screw size, beam thickness and plot area.

# Financial Contributions
GGracy is named after Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, stonewall veteran, LGBT elder and transgender rights advocate living in the United States.
