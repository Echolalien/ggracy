# GGracy - A 2d plotter using CoreXY
GGracy is designed for art installations and other large custom CNC rigs with low accuracy requirements. THIS IS NOT A 3D PRINTER. The jury is out on how reliable and accurate GGracy can be but for the moment it should be assumed to be only capable of slow, gross movements and not fine microsteps. It is designed to be mounted to walls or a wooden frame using 3mm screws. Its parts are all modular and printable on a ~30cm print bed. The fusion360 STEP file includes variables to control screw size, beam thickness and plot area. GGracy utilises the GT2 gearing/timing belt system, but should be modifiable to others provided you can find/print pulleys with <32mm diameter and ~5mm bores. Included in the files are some basic 40 tooth GT2 pulleys including one that has a motor linkage system using an m3 machine screw and hex nut.

# Bill of Materials
Work in progress

2x Timing belts
8x Pulleys
Lots of m3 machine screws
Lots of 3mm wood screws (or whatever material you're attaching to)
A lot of filament (exact weight to come)
A piece of wood or something for the mount in the centre
# Financial Contributions
GGracy is named after Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, stonewall veteran, LGBT elder and transgender rights advocate living in the United States. She is currently fundraising for retirement from a lifetime of organising and resistance; please direct all financial contributions to https://fundly.com/missmajor At such a time that she reaches her funding goals and is able to retire, other LGBT causes will be suggested. Homophobes and transphobes are not permitted to use this project as far as the GPL permits this restriction.
